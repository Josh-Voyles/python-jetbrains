Credit Calculator
A credit calculator is an important tool when you are planning your finances. This project provides a command-line interface to calculate various aspects of a loan such as the payment amount, number of periods to make payments, the principal of the loan, and the type of loan - whether it's a differentiated payment or an annuity payment.

Features:

This Credit Calculator can:
Calculate the monthly payment of a loan given the principal, interest, and time (in months).

Determine the number of payments (periods) given the loan payment, interest, and principal.

Figure out the loan principal given the payment amount, interest, and time (in months).

Distinguish between 'diff' (Differentiated payments) and 'annuity' (Annuity payments) type of loan.

Usage:

The command line application accepts the following arguments:

--principal: The loan principal amount

--payment: The loan payment amount

--periods: The number of periods (months) over which the loan payment is distributed

--interest: The annual interest rate of the loan

--type: The type of loan - 'diff' or 'annuity'

The values should be positive numbers. The interest is specified without the percent sign (e.g., 5.6 means that the interest is 5.6%).

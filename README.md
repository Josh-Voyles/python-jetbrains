# Jet Brain Academy Python Tracks

This repository contains various Python tracks and projects part of a self-study plan at https://hyperskill.org/.

Rather than create separate repositories for each project has I had before, it makes more sense to group them all together.

## Purpose

These projects are constructed to help you learn various aspects of programming.

Each project has multiple stages allow you to gradually learn new techniques and apply them to a specific project.

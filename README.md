# Jet Brain Academy Python Tracks

This repository contains various Python tracks and projects part of my-study plan at [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org).

## Purpose

Hyperskill projects are constructed to help students learn various aspects of programming.

Each project contains multiple lessons and then project phases to help you apply what you learned.

The projects uploaded here are lacking many lesson plan and test files needed to complete the lesson.

I've only uploaded here for the source code examples.
